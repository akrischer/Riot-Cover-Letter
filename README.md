Riot-Cover-Letter
=================

This is a Unity project I made showcasing my passion for League of Legends, and video games in general.

The project was done in Unity 4.6, which utilizes the new GUI system (inspired by nGUI).


### THE JIST

This isn't so much a game as it is an interactive presentation. In this presentation, I introduce my five favorite League
of Legends characters as well as present a chunk of my life story. It is segmented into five parts. In each part, you are
introduced to some new champions and an interactable "scroll" which holds the text. After reading a "scroll," an action
sequence occurs between the League of Legends characters that are on screen.

Many of the art assets used are directly from and completely owned by Riot. 
I do not own nor make any claims for said assets.


### TO RUN
Under /Complete Builds you will find a Windows and Mac version of the Unity Project.

    If you are using the windows build, you must also donwload the _Data folder and have it in the same directory as the
    Unity application file.
    
    There is no associated _Data file for the Mac build.
    
    
    
### FOR CODE SAMPLES
All source code is available and commented under
/Unity Project Files/Assets/Scripts

The project was done entirely in C#, utilizing some Unity Standard Assets Scripts as well as the amazingly awesome
iTween library, visual editor, and visual path editor.

### INTENT

The intent of this project was not only to create a cool interactive cover letter but also to practice my skills
in game programming. It was my first time using the iTween library and the new Unity UI system. It was a great opportunity to explore something new while also relying on my fundamental knowledge of Unity.
